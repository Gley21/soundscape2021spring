So far I have recored and found the first minute of the project.

The first track includes all the narration that I have written and recorded so far.
I still haven't finished writing all the narration and so that is really the next big step because after that is done I can easily find sounds to pair with it.
I just did this first minute to get a general feel of how layering tracks in audacity would work and how I want to pair the  narration with the sounds.

The second track is a recording I did myself of me walking down the stairs in my house and opening my front door to go outside.

The third track is a car driving over cobblestone that I found on Freesound to go with the narration at that point.
I'd like to find at least one other distinct sound to set the scene at this particular point.

The fourth track is a recording of footsteps on concrete that I found on Freesound.
Right now I think these footsteps will be behind every scene I describe where I am actually walking, and will only stop to indicate a break in the walk.

I have a few other scenes planned: Stopping and listening to a trombone player, stoping and lying in a pile of leaves with cars and pedestrians moving by,
walking by a creek in the woods, and returning home. All of these need narration written as well as sounds found.

If anyone gets a chance to listen I was wondering what you think of the tone and style of the narration.
I wanted it to read in a more poetic manner so that the words and sounds complement each other instead of the importance being placed on one or the other.
Also, in regards to the tone, is it too dry? Too tired sounding?
I'm trying to go for a "chill" vibe for the whole track, but don't want it to come off as low energy either.
