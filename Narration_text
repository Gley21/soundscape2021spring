This is the story of a walk.
One to nowhere in particular.


Headed downwards, out the door

Nowhere on the mind

Attention caught by olden stairs
Ascent turns back the clock
Cobblestone streets rumble
Aged construction looks on

Down again, to somewhere new!
A sweet sound befalls the ears
Trombone song fills the air
Take a moment and enjoy

The walk continues, down the street
Out of the corner of the eye a place to rest
Fallen leaves make the perfect bed
Close the eyes and listen close

Up again walking on
A wooden cove now in full view
Never noticed this before
Duck inside to find a creek, ready to be explored

Headed upward, through the door

Everywhere on the mind
