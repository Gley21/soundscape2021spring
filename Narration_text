This is the story of a walk.
One to nowhere in particular.


Headed downwards, out the door

Nowhere on the mind

Attention caught by olden stair
Ascent reveals a world unknown
The sound of cars on cobblestone fills the air
Moss covered brick adorns every home

Down again, to the Cathedral square
A sweet sound befalls the ear
A trombone song played with care
Listening helps the mind clear

The walk continues, down the street
Past busy people, speeding car
Fallen leaves make the perfect place to rest the feet
Close the eyes, be where you are

Rise again, exploration awaits
A wooden cove comes into view
Duck under branches, through nature's gates
A cold creek swirls, setting sun changes hue

The air has chilled, the moon appears
Time to return to the familiar place
Taking home memories as souviners
Reflection on the journey sets the pace

Headed upward, through the door

Everywhere on the mind
