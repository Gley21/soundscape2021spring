This is the story of a walk.
One to nowhere in particular.





Headed downwards, out the door

Nowhere on the mind

Attention caught by olden stairs
Ascent turns back the clock
Cobblestone streets rumble
Aged construction looks on

Down again, to somewhere new!
A sweet sound befalls the ears
Trombone song fills the air
Take a moment and enjoy
