Walking Nowhere 

The most important part of a journey is rarely the end, but the space in between the start and the finish. I hope that this soundscape might encourage you to go and have a walk to nowhere of your own. You might get anywhere, but take a moment and enjoy the trip. By the end you might find you went to more places than you could've imagined, simply by going nowhere at all.
